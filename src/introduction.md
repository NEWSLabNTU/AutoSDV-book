The Race Vehicle project features an affordable autonomous driving
platform with practical vehicle equipments for educational and
research institutes. This project allows you to build a self-driving
platform at home and use it in real outdoor road environments. Driven
by Autoware, the leading open-source software project for autonomous
driving, it gives you great flexibility and extensivity on the vehicle
software.
